We were looking for a way to create simple invoices using a "print merge" approach that wouldn't require offline software. We wanted a solution on the cloud, free, compatible with Google Drive and possibly open source.

### Update! February, 25th 2016
You should use the last version of autoCrat. Examples here are not up to date, sorry.

### Update! May, 4th 2015
After April 20th, autoCrat script stopped working again. Here it is a fix:

Go to Tools -> Script Editor. Then go to Edit -> Find and replace.

* Find `DocsList` and replace all with `DriveApp`
* Find `"document"` (both lowercase and uppercase, with quotes) and replace all with `MimeType.GOOGLE_DOCS`
* Find `getFileType` and replace all with `getMimeType`
* Find `file.addToFolder(folder)` and replace all with `folder.addFile(file)`
* Find `copy.addToFolder(parent)` and replace with `parent.addFile(copy)`
* Find `pdfFile.addToFolder(secondaryFolder)` and replace with `secondaryFolder.addFile(pdfFile)`
* Find `file.addToFolder(secondaryFolder)` and replace with `secondaryFolder.addFile(file)`
* Find `copy.removeFromFolder(root)` and replace with `DriveApp.removeFile(copy)`
* Find `pdfFile.removeFromFolder(DriveApp.getRootFolder())` and replace with `DriveApp.removeFile(pdfFile)`
* Find `file.removeFromFolder(DriveApp.getRootFolder())` and replace with `DriveApp.removeFile(file)`

Fortunately there is [autoCrat](http://cloudlab.newvisions.org/scripts/autocrat), a [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) that meets our requirements and we want to share our experience.

autoCrat has a very good documentation and a video tutorial, it was very simple to setup and use. There are some issues with formatted fields (dates, currencies...) but we found a very simple workaround. Let's say the field `B2` contains January, 20th 2014 (in date format). autoCrat will produce **Mon Jan 20 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)**. You can add a new cell with the formula `=TEXT(B2; "mm-dd-yyyy")` and instruct autoCrat to use the new column. We did the same thing for money values (`=TEXT(F2; "$ #,###.00")`). After doing this, you can hide these "helpers" columns in the spreadsheet.

A working example is available [in this Google Drive shared folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1PWGPmnhgWhU2dtd3k0RVpwQzA&usp=drive_web)
